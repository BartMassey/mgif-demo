mgif-demo: demo of synthesizing an MGIF using various Rust crates
Bart Massey 2023

This contains the same simple example as deployed using
various Rust crates with MGIF writing support. The examples
make a two-frame looping 128Ã—128 MGIF in `flasher.gif` in
the directory in which the are run.

These examples should probably be upstreamed to the various
crates in which they apply.
